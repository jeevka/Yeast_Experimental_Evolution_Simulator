To compile and run the simulations execute the command below in terminal from where the codes are located.

sh Yeast_Simulator.sh

To change the parameters you can edit line number 9 in "Yeast_Simulator.sh" file. 

-m mutations rate per genome per cell division
-s shape value for gamma distribution
-l scale value for gamma distribution
-f proportion of fitness affecting mutations
-b proportion of beneficial mutations in fitness affecting mutation

R code will plot the outputs.
